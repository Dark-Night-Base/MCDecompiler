# MinecraftDecompiler

This decompiler is for 1.13.1 for now as we really need it for that version only, its wip (for now only decompiling and file tree and renaming is done), the class name renaming will be implemented asap.
Cfr is distributed by http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/ (no source disclosed yet and still in beta)
Srg mappings are kindly provided by skyrising: https://github.com/skyrising/mc-data

Run "forlazy.bat" or decompiler.py (you will need python 3.6+, ok lets say 3.7 to be sure)
You will need ofc, java jre and jdk (8 is fine) and 1.13.1.jar either in the folder with decompiler.py or in the regular windows directory (%appdata%/.minecraft/versions/1.13.1/1.13.1.jar)
