# MinecraftDecompiler

This decompiler is for 1.13.1 for now as we really need it for that version only, its wip (for now only decompiling and file tree and renaming is done), the class name renaming will be implemented asap.


Cfr is distributed by http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/ (no source disclosed yet and still in beta) (its under MIT: http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/license.html)


Srg mappings are kindly provided by skyrising: https://github.com/skyrising/mc-data (not sure about the license but its data so i guess like always, use it but credit author and dont sell it but can use it to make mods)

Run "forlazy.bat" or decompiler.py (you will need python 3.6+, ok lets say 3.7 to be sure)
You will need ofc, java jre and jdk (8 is fine) and 1.13.1.jar either in the folder with decompiler.py or in the regular windows directory (%appdata%/.minecraft/versions/1.13.1/1.13.1.jar)


My license is pretty simple, dont sell that programs nor any part, you can make mods and sell them, that i dont care. I dont provide support, its litterally a one click solution so if it dont work pls go to the top and re read. Its open source and free, have fun.
